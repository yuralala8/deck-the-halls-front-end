# Deck the Halls

Prepare for this yearâ€™s holiday season by making a wish list and sharing it with friends. Generate a Secret Santa for all the party attendees and send out invitations.

## Introduction

In order to use this web app, users must sign up and log in. Users can edit their profile with their own image file and add a bio. Users can also add wishes to their wish list by either using the item search functionality under 'Shopping Ideas', or manually creating their own wish by adding details.

Users can search for other users and add them as friends. Once added, a request is pending until the other user accepts the request. When the other user accepts the request, a mutual friendship is established and each user is viewable under 'View Friends.' Users can also create parties and add their friends as participants to each party. Each party generates a Secret Santa for each participant. This is randomized. On the instance of hosting a party, every participant will receive the invitation with party details on it, and each user will be able to see the name of the person he/she is a secret santa for.
